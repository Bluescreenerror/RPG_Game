The game is as generic as the name is. Got a little too ambitious with my coding skills and this is the product of that.

`pip install easygui` to install easygui. 

The game works. Sometimes the user money can get negative and I really don't know why that happens or how to fix it. At this point I've embraced it and I endorse it as a feature rather than a bug. 

If you're reading this, love you <3.
